# 스프링부트 + 리액트 + 시큐리티 + JWT 공부

## 리액트 + 인텔리J 연동

1. 인텔리J 설치 + VsCode 설치 
2. node.js 설치 ( 모듈 사용을 위해 설치 필요 => npm )
3. npm은 에러뜰 경우 yarn 사용.
4. 스프링부트 프로젝트 생성 후 터미널에서 프로젝트 경로 src/main 이동 후 => npx create-react-app [프로젝트명]
5. vsCode에서 파일 내려받은 후 npm start 리엑트 실행
6. 중요! corss 에러가 나기때문에 package.json에 "proxy": "http://localhost:8080" 경로를 지정해줘야함.
7. build.gradle에 추가 

def frontendDir = "$projectDir/src/main/reactfront"

sourceSets {
	main {
		resources { srcDirs = ["$projectDir/src/main/resources"]
		}
	}
}

processResources { dependsOn "copyReactBuildFiles" }

task installReact(type: Exec) {
	workingDir "$frontendDir"
	inputs.dir "$frontendDir"
	group = BasePlugin.BUILD_GROUP
	if (System.getProperty('os.name').toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).contains('windows')) {
		commandLine "npm.cmd", "audit", "fix"
		commandLine 'npm.cmd', 'install' }
	else {
		commandLine "npm", "audit", "fix" commandLine 'npm', 'install'
	}
}

task buildReact(type: Exec) {
	dependsOn "installReact"
	workingDir "$frontendDir"
	inputs.dir "$frontendDir"
	group = BasePlugin.BUILD_GROUP
	if (System.getProperty('os.name').toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).contains('windows')) {
		commandLine "npm.cmd", "run-script", "build"
	} else {
		commandLine "npm", "run-script", "build"
	}
}

task copyReactBuildFiles(type: Copy) {
	dependsOn "buildReact"
	from "$frontendDir/build"
	into "$projectDir/src/main/resources/static"
}

8. axios통신 할 경우 3000번 포트를 받을 경로 지정 해줘야 한다. corss에러

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
